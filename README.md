# AmalgamationOfWeather

Amalgamation of Weather Forecast (Rainfall, Precipitation, Humidity,
Temperature & other standard weather parameters) from multiple free public data
streams & APIs (Open Weather, ForecastIo, Weather Underground,
Aeris-weather, Open-weather Map etc.& many more. A more detailed list can be
furnished later) & amalgamate these through some statistical averaging to produce a
single integrated weather forecast stream for a particular geo location within a 2 Km
radius. We would like to provide this information on our App & also publish an API if
possible.

## Features
